	<p>We are happy to report the release of <b>CKEditor 5 v10.1.0</b>. This version includes the first iteration of the table feature as well as support for soft line breaks (<code>Shift</code>+<code>Enter</code>). Apart from that, we introduced a selection post-fixer and fixed many text composition issues thanks to major improvements to the <a href="https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_renderer-Renderer.html">DOM renderer</a>. There is also a (temporary) workaround for typing before and after imagesâ€¦ and a bunch of important bug fixes. Read on for details.</p>
	<h3>New features</h3>
	<p>The tables are here! This release also includes the first new plugin that was volunteered by a member of the community in response to the need expressed by the developers, and we are really grateful for the help.</p>
